                the state of Kerala, India. Established in the year 1966, Kasaragod was the first municipal town in the district. It is the northernmost
                district of Kerala and is also known as Saptha Bhasha Sangama Bhoomi (The land of seven languages).

                River, which is also the longest river in the district, empties into Arabian Sea.

                <h3 class="subhead">Etymology</h3>
                <span id="sub"></span>
            <p class="discription2">There are different views on the derivation of the name Kasaragod. One view is that it is the combination of two Sanskrit
                words kaasara (which means lake or pond) and kroda (which means a place where treasure is kept).
                Kasaragod was known as Kanhirakode (The land of kāñiram trees) in Malayalam, Kaanjiram is Malayalam for Kasaraka trees (Kannada name) found 
                in abundance here.
                Kasaragod was under Kumbla dynasty until 16th century, which was vassal to the kingdom of Kolathunadu based at Kannur.
                Kannada kingdoms focused on the port and surroundings in the 16th century CE.
                Tulunad, where Tulu is traditionally spoken, is said to be bound on the south by the Chandragiri river and fort, thus
                including Kasaragod city within the Tulunad region. Though linguistically the Tulu country extends to the south only up to 
                the Chandragiri river at present, culturally the region between the Chandragiri and the Kavai (Kavvayi) rivers has remained as a 
                twilight zone between the Malayalam and the Tulu countries.
                The Kalyanapuri and the Chandragiri rivers in the erstwhile British South Canara district are regarded as the ancient and present 
                boundaries of Tulu language.

                <p class="discription2">
                    Kasaragod, about 50 km south of Mangalore city, was an important centre of trade in earlier times. Ramacharitam, probably the oldest
                    literary work written in Old Malayalam, which dates back to 12th century CE, is thought to have written in Kasargod district as its
                    manuscripts were discovered from Nileshwaram and the poem mentions about Ananthapura Lake Temple in Kumbla in detail.[15] Kasaragod was
                    known to the Arabs by the name Harkwillia.[5] The Malik Dinar Mosque in Kasaragod town is one of the oldest Masjids in the Indian subcontinent.
                    According to Qissat Shakarwati Farmad, the
                    Masjids at Kodungallur, Kollam, Madayi, Barkur, Mangalore, Kasaragod, Kannur, Dharmadam, Panthalayini, and Chaliyam, were built during the era of
                    Malik Dinar, and they are among the oldest Masjids in Indian subcontinent.[17] It is believed that Malik Dinar was died at Thalangara in Kasaragod 
                    town.[16] Many Arab travelers visiting Kerala between the 9th and the 14th centuries visited Kasaragod, being an important trade centre then. Duarte 
                    Barbosa, a Portuguese traveler who visited Kumbla, near Kasaragod Town in 1514 recorded that rice being exported for coir to Maldives.[5] According to
                    Barbosa, the people in the southwestern Malabar coast 
                    of India from Kumbla in the north to Kanyakumari in the south had spoke a unique language, which they called as "Maliama" (Malayalam).[18]
                    Until 16th century CE, Kasargod town was known by the name Kanhirakode (may be by the meaning, 'The land of Kanhira Trees') in Malayalam.[1] The Kumbla 
                    dynasty, who swayed over the land of southern Tulu Nadu wedged between Chandragiri River and Netravati River (including present-day Taluks of Manjeshwar 
                    and Kasaragod) from Maipady Palace at Kumbla, had also been vassals to the Kolathunadu kingdom of North Malabar, before the Carnatic conquests of Vijayanagara
                    Empire.[19] The Kumbla dynasty had a mixed lineage of Malayali Nairs and Tuluva Brahmins.[9] They also claimed their origin from Cheraman Perumals of Kerala.
                    Francis Buchanan-Hamilton states that the customs of Kumbla dynasty were similar to those of the contemporary Malayali kings.[9]
