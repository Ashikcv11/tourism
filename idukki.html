            <p class="subhed">" This beautiful High
                range district of Kerala is geographically known for its Mountainous Hills and Dense Forests"</p>
            <p class="discription">Idukki is one of the 14 districts of Kerala state, India, created on 26 January 1972. This beautiful High
                 range district of Kerala is geographically known for its Mountainous Hills and Dense Forests. For the people of Kerala, Idukki 
                is always associated with Power Generation. About 66% of the Stateâ€™s Power needs come from the Hydroelectric Power Projects in Idukki.
                Idukki which lies in the Western Ghats of Kerala is the second largest district in area but has the lowest population density. 
                Idukki has a vast forest reserve area; more than a half of the district is covered by forests. The urban areas are densely populated 
                whereas villages are sparsely populated. Idukki is also known as the spice garden of Kerala</p>
                <h3 class="subhead">Geography</h3>
                <span id="sub"></span>
            <p class="discription2">The Idukki district forms a high altitude plateau with rugged mountainous terrain, 
                several river valleys and deep gorges.[7] The entire northern part of the district forms a sub plateua
                 higher than the rest of the district, this region includes the tallest peaks like Anamudi and includes
                the areas around Munnar, Pallivasal, Kanthalloor, Vattavada and Mankulam. The Pambar river valley (Marayoor, Keezhanthoor)
                forms an eastern sloping rain shadow region of the Western Ghats. The eastern frontier of the district (Kumily, Kattapana,
                Nedumkandam, Rajakumari and Ramakkalmedu) constitutes the Cardamon hills. The western part of the district is covered by 
                forests and hills bordering the eastern regions of Ernakulam and Kottayam district like Neriyamangalam, Vannapuram,
                Thommankuthu, Moolamattom, Vagamon and Kuttikanam. Places like Thodupuzha, Koothattukulam, Udumbanoor
                and Muttom are situated in the semi elevated Thodupuzha river plains with scattered hills. The Periyar 
                river basin in the district which includes Vandiperiyar, Ayyapankoil, Rajakkad, Idukki, Cheruthoni and Adimaly
                is an elevated plateua crisscrossed by river valleys and lies between the high peaks of the western and eastern
                parts of the district. The southern region is entirely covered with the forests of the Periyar National Park.

                <p class="discription2">
                    <b>Munnar</b> was the summer resort of the British Government in the south.
                    The town is situated at the convergence of three mountain streams, namely Muthirappuzha, Nallathanni,
                    and Kundala. Munnar has some of the largest tea plantations in the world. This hill station, which is 
                    more than 5,000 feet above sea level, is a tourist attraction noted for its scenic landscapes.
                    Most of the native flora and fauna of Munnar have disappeared due to severe habitat fragmentation resultant from the 
                    creation of the plantations. However, some species continue to survive and thrive in several protected areas nearby, 
                    including the new Kurinjimala Sanctuary to the east, the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, Manjampatti Valley, and the Amaravati
                    reserve forest of Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary to the northeast, the Eravikulam National Park and Anamudi Shola National
                    Park in the north, and the Pampadum Shola National Park to the south. The Palani Hills National Park is proposed to come up 
                    to the east of Idukki. These protected areas are especially known for several threatened and endemic species including the 
                    Nilgiri tahr, the grizzled giant squirrel, the Nilgiri wood-pigeon, the elephant, the gaur, the Nilgiri langur, the sambar,
                    and the neelakurinji (that blossoms only once in twelve years).
                    The former Kundala Valley Railway in Munnar was destroyed by a flood in 1924, but tourism officials are considering
                    reconstructing the railway line to attract tourists.

                    <b>Eravikulam Wild Life Sanctuary</b> 
                    Eravikulam is another wildlife sanctuary proclaimed as a National Park. It supports the largest population 
                    of Nilgiri tahr in the world. Anamudi peak is on the southern part of this park. Most of the park is grassland
                    and the average altitude is more than 5000 feet above sea level. Heavy rain and gushing winds make the area inaccessible
                    during the monsoon season. The famous Neelakurinji (Strobilanthes kunthiana) grows here. It has a flowering cycle of 12 years.
                    Twenty-six species of mammals have been recorded in the park including the largest surviving population of Nilgiri tahr,estimated
                    at 750 individuals. The other ungulates are gaur, Indian muntjac and sambar deer. Golden jackal, jungle cat, wild dog, dhole, leopard and 
                    tiger are the main predators. Some little-known animals such as Nilgiri langur, stripe-necked mongoose, Indian porcupine, Nilgiri marten, 
                    small clawed otter, ruddy mongoose, and dusky palm squirrel are also found.Elephants make seasonal visits.   
                    132 species of birds have been recorded which include endemics like black-and-orange flycatcher, Nilgiri pipit, Nilgiri wood pigeon,
                    white bellied shortwing, Nilgiri flycatcher and Kerala laughingthrush.
                    ecosystem like the red disk bushbrown and Palni four-wing are among the 101 species in the park.
