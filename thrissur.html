            <span></span>
            <p class="subhed">"Thrissur is also known as the Cultural Capital of Kerala"</p>
            <p class="discription"> Trichur, also known by its historical name Thrissivaperur, is a city and the headquarters 
                of the Thrissur district in Kerala, India. It is the third largest urban agglomeration in Kerala after Kochi and Kozhikode,
                and the 21st largest in India.The city is built around a 65-acre (26 ha) hillock called the Thekkinkaadu Maidaanam
                which seats a large Hindu temple. 
                It is located central of the state, and 304 kilometres (189 mi) north-west of the state's capital city, 
                Thiruvananthapuram. Thrissur was once the capital of the Kingdom of Cochin, and was a point of contact for the Assyrians, Greeks, 
                Persians, Arabs, Romans, Portuguese, Dutch and English.
                Thrissur is also known as the Cultural Capital of Kerala because of its cultural, spiritual and religious leanings throughout history.
                It contains the Kerala Sangeetha Nadaka Academy, Kerala Lalithakala Akademi and Kerala Sahitya Academy.The city hosts the Thrissur
                Pooram festival, the most colourful and spectacular temple festival in Kerala. The festival is held at the Thekkinkadu Maidan in 
                April or May, in the Malayalam month 'medam'.</p>
                <h3 class="subhead">Geography</h3>
                <span id="sub"></span>
            <p class="discription2">Thrissur is the headquarters of Thrissur district, in the centre of the Indian state of Kerala. The city is 
                75 km north-east of Kochi, 133 km south-west of Coimbatore, 124 km south-east of Kozhikode and 151 km north of Changanacherry.
                The city is located in a hillock called Thekkinkadu Maidan which is the
                second highest point in city after the Vilangan Hills. The city has an average altitude of 2.83 metres above sea level.
                From the hillock, the city gradually flattens into the Thrissur-Ponnani Kole Wetlands, which act as a natural drainage for the 
                city. The water from the wetlands flows via rivers into the Laccadive Sea, keeping Thrissur city safe from the major flooding that 
                affects most other cities in Kerala.
                The city is located in midland regions of Kerala, with an extended part of Palakkad plains.The city geologically is composed of 
                Archaean gneisses and crystalline schists. Major parts of city is covered by Archaean rocks. The city lies near the centre of the 
                Indian tectonic plate (the Indian Plate) and is subject to comparatively little seismic or volcanic activity.

                <p class="discription2">
                    The presence of numerous prehistoric megaliths and dolmens indicate that Thrissur has been occupied since at least 
                    1000 BCE to 500 CE.

                    The Portuguese had naval influence in many parts of Kerala in the 16th century, including Thrissur. In the beginning of 
                    the 17th century the Portuguese naval power was reduced and Dutch became the main naval power. With the help of the Dutch,
                    the royal family of the Kingdom of Cochin recaptured Thrissur from the Zamorin of Calicut in 1710. 
                    Thrissur rose to importance after Maharaja Sakthan Thampuran ascended the throne of Kingdom of Cochin (1769–1805) 
                    and made Thrissur his capital. The Maharaja made the city into a major financial and commercial hub of South India, 
                    by inviting Syrian Christian families and Brahmins from adjoining areas.
                    During 1750–60 Hyder Ali, the Sultan of the powerful Kingdom of Mysore, conquered Thrissur, making it a tributary of Mysore. In 1786, the son
                    of Tipu Sultan of Mysore led another invasion of Thrissur, but retreated after the Srirangapattanam war.[24] In the meantime, Rama Varma X, 
                    the successor of 
                    Sakthan Thampuran signed a treaty with the East India Company, transforming the state of Cochin into a British Protectorate.[citation needed]

                    The Indian independence movement gained momentum after a Committee was formed at the 1919 meeting of the Indian National Congress. The civil disobedience 
                    movement attracted many people in Thrissur in subsequent years, and Mahatma Gandhi visited the city in 1927 and 1934 to promote it.
                    R. K. Shanmukham Chetty, the controversial Diwan of Cochin Kingdom from 1935 to 1941, developed the city by constructing Thrissur Town Hall and Ramanilayam, 
                    buildings which remain important in Kerala politics. Other important civic buildings and infrastructure constructed around this time include the Municipal Corporation
                    Building of Thrissur and the Swaraj Round.[27][28]
                    In 1947, when India gained independence from colonial rule, Thrissur was part of the Kingdom of Cochin. Thrissur district was formed on 1 July 1949, with the headquarters
                     at the city of Thrissur.
