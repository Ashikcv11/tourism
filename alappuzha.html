            <h1>Alappuzha</h1>
            <span></span>
            <p class="subhed">"Alappuzha was home to the Punnapra-Vayalar uprising against the Separate American Model independent"</p>
            <p class="discription"> Alappuzha also known by its former name Alleppey, is the administrative headquarters of Alappuzha district in
                the Indian state of Kerala. Alleppey is a city and a municipality in Kerala with an urban population of 174,164 and ranks third
                among the districts in literacy rate in the state. In 2016, the Centre for Science and Environment rated Alappuzha as the 
                cleanest town in India. Alappuzha is considered to be the oldest planned city in this region and the lighthouse built on
                the coast of the city is the first of its kind along the Laccadive Sea coast.
                The city is situated -55 km from Kochi1 and 155  km north of Trivandrum . A town with canals, backwaters, beaches, and lagoons,
                Alappuzha was described by George Curzon, Viceroy of India at the start of the 20th century, as the "Venice of the East."
                Hence, it is known as the "Venetian Capital" of Kerala.
                It is an important tourist destination in India. The Backwaters of Alappuzha is one of the most popular tourist attractions in
                Kerala which attracts millions of domestic and international tourists to the district and employs vast number of locals in the 
                private sector. It connects Kumarakom and Cochin to the North and Quilon to the South.
                It is also the access point for the annual Nehru Trophy Boat Race, held on the Punnamada Lake, near Alappuzha, 
                on the second Saturday of August every year. This is the most popular and competitive boat races in India.</p>
                <h3 class="subhead">Geography</h3>
                <span id="sub"></span>
            <p class="discription2">Alappuzha is located at 9.54°N 76.40°E. The average elevation is 1 metre (3.3 ft) Alappuzha covers 
                an area of 1,414 square kilometres (546 sq mi) and is flanked by 2,195 square kilometres (847 sq mi) of Vembanad Lake, where six 
                major rivers spread out before joining the 80 km coast line of the district. The city of Alappuzha is crisscrossed by a system of 
                canals, which is a part of the National Waterway 3.
                The district is a sandy strip of land intercepted by lagoons, rivers and canals. There are no mountains or hills in the district except 
                some scattered
                hillocks lying between Bharanikkavu and Chengannur blocks in the eastern portion of the district. There are no forest area in this district.
                Alappuzha is bounded by the Laccadive Sea on its west. The town has a network of lakes, lagoons and fresh water rivers. The richness of the 
                coastal Alappuzha waters is expressed annually in the blooming and consequent deposit of a huge quantity of fishes and prawns on the Alappuzha
                coast called ‘[Chakara]’. This annual shifting of sandbank appears during the post-monsoon period and contributes to the local economy and is
                a festive season for the people of Kerala. The annual floods rejuvenate and cleanse the soil 
                and water due to which there is abundance of marine life like prawns, lobsters, fishes, turtles and other flora in the sea.

            <h3 class="subhead">History</h3>
                <span id="sub"></span>
                


                <p class="discription2">
                    Kuttanad, the rice bowl of Kerala, with its paddy fields, small streams and canals with lush green coconut palms, was well 
                    known even from the early periods of the Sangam age. History says Alappuzha had trade relations with Greece and Rome in 
                    the Middle Ages.
                    The early Cheras, who had their home in Kuttanad, were called `Kuttuvans`, so named after this place. Pliny and Ptolemy of 
                    the 1st and 2nd centuries had mentioned places like Purakkad or Barace in their classical works.
                    Literary works like "Unnuneeli Sandesam" give some insight into the ancient period of this district. Archaeological antiquities
                    ,such as the stone inscriptions, historical monuments found in the temples, churches, and rock-cut caves, also emphasise the historic
                    importance of Alappuzha District. Christianity had a foothold in this district, even from the 1st century AD. The church located at 
                    Kokkamangalam was one of the seven churches founded by St. Thomas,[citation needed] one of the twelve disciples of Jesus Christ. It is
                    generally believed that he landed at Maliankara in Muziris Port, presently known as Cranganore or Kodungallur, in 52 AD and preached 
                    Christianity in South India.
                    The district flourished in religion and culture under the second Chera Empire, during 9th to 12th centuries AD. The 
                    literary work, `Ascharya Choodamani`, a Sanskrit drama written by Sakthibhadran, a scholar of Chengannur,
                    enables us to know many pertinent facts. Further, the temple on Lord Ayyappan, in Mukkal vattam near Muhamma in
                    Alappuzha District, is called Cheerappanchira, for the Kalari from which Lord Ayyappa learnt his martial arts.
                    A recent album by P. Unni Krishnan on Lord Ayyappa, titled 'Sabarimalai Va Charanam Solli Va', has songs illustrating the 
                    history of this temple and Lord Ayyappa's stay here before he went to conquer the Mahishi Demon Kerala.
